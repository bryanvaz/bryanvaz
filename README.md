### Heya! 👋

Just stashing my software projects here. Don't let anyone at my day job know I can code. 🤫

### 💼 Fun facts
* I'm a management consultant by day 📈, software developer by night 💻
* I accidently moved a company to serverless, and as punishment they made me CTO 🦫
* I'm a Canadian 🇨🇦
* I'm a coffee nerd ☕

### Projects I'm working on
* [bryanvaz/vfnet](https://github.com/bryanvaz/vfnet) - A Virtual Function manager for network devices
* [Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT) - An experimental open-source attempt to make GPT-4 fully autonomous. 
* [bryanvaz/advent_2022](https://github.com/bryanvaz/advent_2022) - Working through the basics to learn Go & Rust

### ☕ Recent coffee

_Archived coffee is from my archival freezer. While you might not be able to puchase it anymore, keep an eye on the producers and when their lots go up for auction next year. Ask whoever won the lot to place an order, or better yet, recommend it to your local roaster to bid on next year._
